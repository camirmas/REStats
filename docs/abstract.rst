Forecasting plays an important role in grid-connected wind systems, and is often used in planning for demand response or participation in futures markets. Power curve prediction has also proven useful in understanding turbines perform, and how to monitor their health, in real conditions. Recently, probabilistic techniques have gained popularity: these represent a greater potential for decision-making under uncertainty by utilizing posterior distributions of predicted power output. While these approaches are becoming more common in wind energy science, their applications for hybrid systems, especially wind/hydrogen systems, are limited. This document demonstrates that probabilistic forecasting and prediction can be applied to analyze and predict the performance of hybrid systems. It presents a robust, modular strategy for coupling wind speed forecasts with power curve prediction, and develops a case study using operational data from the Kelmarsh wind farm to project hour-ahead hydrogen production for a coupled wind/hydrogen system. This approach establishes a foundation for analysis that is readily extended to accommodate different forecasting strategies and horizons, and highlights future opportunities for control and monitoring of hybrid systems.
