`REStats` is a Python package that provides tools and models for analyzing and predicting the
performance of hybrid wind/hydrogen systems. It couples wind speed forecasts with power curve
prediction, offering a modular framework for robust analysis and decision-making under uncertainty.

## Features

- Wind speed Weibull distribution fitting
- Wind speed data preprocessing utilities
- ARMA wind speed and wind direction forecast modeling
- Power curve outlier filtering utilities
- Gaussian Process Regression power curve prediction
- Simulations for wind power forecasting applied to Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) hydrogen electrolyzer production
- Plotting and visualization utilities
