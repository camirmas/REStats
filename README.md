`REStats` is a Python package that provides tools and models for analyzing and predicting the
performance of hybrid wind/hydrogen systems. It couples wind speed forecasts with power curve
prediction, offering a modular framework for robust analysis and decision-making under uncertainty.

## Models

- Wind speed Weibull distribution fitting
- ARMA wind speed and wind direction forecast modeling
- Gaussian Process Regression power curve prediction
- Simulations for wind power forecasting applied to Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) hydrogen electrolyzer production

## Installation

`pip install git+https://github.com/camirmas/REStats`
